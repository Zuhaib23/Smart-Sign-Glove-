# ðŸ§¤ Smart Sign Glove

The **Smart Sign Glove** is a low-cost wearable device designed to recognize hand gestures based on finger flexing using flex sensors. It combines **Arduino**, **Python**, and **MATLAB** to train a machine learning model, extract gesture threshold values, and finally embed the logic into Arduino for offline use.

---

## ðŸ§  System Overview

1. **Data Collection (Python)**  
   Read real-time flex sensor data from Arduino and save labeled samples.

2. **Training & Threshold Extraction (MATLAB)**  
   Use KNN to classify gestures and extract **flex value ranges** (thresholds) for each gesture.

3. **Deployment to Arduino**  
   Hardcode the threshold values for each gesture into Arduino, allowing offline real-time gesture detection without Python or MATLAB.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Collect gesture data using flex sensors and Python
- Classify gestures using MATLAB's KNN algorithm
- Automatically generate threshold ranges for each gesture
- Final Arduino sketch runs independently to recognize gestures in real time
